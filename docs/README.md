## Features

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Predicts heart failure risks to enable proactive healthcare.
- **Data Visualization**: Offers graphical representations of patient health data for better understanding.
- **Remote Accessibility**: Allows patients and doctors to access data from anywhere, enhancing convenience.
- **Secure Data Storage**: Ensures the safety and privacy of sensitive patient information.

## Technology and Implementation

1. **Java and Spring Boot**
   - Backend developed using Java, fulfilling the requirements of the CO225 module.
   - Spring Boot framework utilized for its simplicity and ease of setting up a production-ready backend.

2. **React and Tailwind CSS**
   - React chosen for the frontend, leveraging its component-based architecture for modular development.
   - Tailwind CSS provides modern styling capabilities that work seamlessly with React, enabling efficient design implementation.

3. **Python for Machine Learning**
   - Python facilitates the integration of machine learning models into the project.
   - Predictive algorithms developed to assess the risk of heart failure among patients using data from the system, assisting in proactive healthcare.
